"PHP Programming Basics" Video Series Resource Pack
===================================================

This is the collection of files that are used in the "[PHP Programming Basics](http://buildamodule.com/collection/php-programming-basics)" video collection on [BuildAModule](http://buildamodule.com). While this series is useful for getting those who want to work with Drupal up to speed with PHP, it's also useful in general for anyone trying to learn PHP or basic programming skills. In this series, we discuss:

* How to work with variables
* How to create and organize functions
* How to work with a MySQL database
* How to build a basic CMS (Content Management System) from scratch

Many of the files here use a custom '.step' extension, which are referred to as 'step files'. This convention allows you to open all of the files in the editor of your choice, allows us to make hidden files visible, and makes it clear that the name of the step file is not the name of the final file that you will be using.

Enjoy!
